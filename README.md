# Code-Alpha_Task-Automation-with-Python-Scripts
This Python automation script simplifies repetitive tasks by moving all .jpg files from one folder to another. Using os and shutil, it checks directories, identifies files, and organizes them automatically, showcasing file handling and automation in Python.
The Task Automation project is designed to demonstrate the power of Python in simplifying repetitive, real-life tasks. The primary objective of this project is to automate a small but useful activity such as moving specific files, extracting data, or scraping basic information from the web. Automation reduces manual effort, increases productivity, and helps avoid human error in repetitive tasks.
In this implementation, the chosen task is moving all .jpg files from one folder to another. The program uses Python’s built-in modules os and shutil to handle file system operations. The script first checks if the target folder exists; if not, it creates one automatically. It then iterates through the source folder, identifies files with the .jpg extension, and moves them to the target folder. The program prints the filenames as they are moved, providing real-time feedback to the user.
This project highlights Python’s ability to interact with the operating system and manage files effortlessly. By modifying the script, users can extend it to automate other tasks such as copying files of different formats, organizing downloads, or backing up important documents. The simplicity and flexibility of Python make it an excellent choice for such automation.
Overall, this project demonstrates essential skills in file handling, directory management, and modular programming. It emphasizes problem-solving using Python’s standard libraries and shows how even a few lines of code can significantly simplify daily workflows.
